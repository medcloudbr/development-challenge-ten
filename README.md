About Medcloud:

We make exams and medical data management more flexible, secure and effective by accelerating the transition from clinics and hospitals to the cloud.
The RIS and PACS systems have been practically the same for the past 25 years. Interoperability problems, high costs and a lack of understanding about the patient's access to his medical records.

These points defined limits for the doctor-patient relationship and barriers to radiology workflows. We are revolutionizing this through a Care Coordination based solution that improves workflows for providers and integrates doctors and patients for a better experience.

Since our foundation, almost 10 years ago, we have prioritized excellence in the management of health data, structuring workflows of health professionals, clinics, laboratories and hospitals for assertive and quality diagnostics.

We understand that behind each medical record there is a patient seeking to improve his health and the hope of family members for his well being. After all, we are all patients, and Medcloud's mission is to help you live longer and better. #PatientFirst

Medcloud's challenge for Dev Full Stack.

## Goal

- To develop a web application (CRUD) to manage patient registers (Patient's name, birth date, email and address) using a cloud database and serverless architecture.

## Required

- You need to develop both the front-end using React Typescript and the back-end using Node.js.
- Back-end hosted on AWS using free-tier.
- AWS RDS MySQL, AWS RDS PostgreSQL or AWS DynamoDB as database.
- AWS Lambda for serverless architecture.
- AWS API Gateway or AppSync for managing your back-end.
- Follow the protoype.

## What will be evaluated:
- State management (Redux Saga or React Query).
- Paginated queries.
- Use Material UI (https://material-ui.com) or Tailwind (https://tailwindcss.com/).
- React Hook Form.
- Field validation on front-end and back-end (date, required fields, number, max-length).
- AWS best practices.
- Clean and organized code (naming, component, pages, assets, etc.)
- Knowledge of patterns (PSRs, design patterns, SOLID).
- Be consistent and know how to argue your choices.
- Present solutions you master.
- Data Modeling.
- Code maintainability.
- Error handling.

According to the above criteria, we will evaluate your test in order to proceed to the technical interview. If you have not acceptably achieved what we are proposing above, we will not proceed with the process.

## Delivery

You MUST clone this repository to your own private repository and push your code to it. 
When you finish it, you must send an email to cv@medcloud.com.br with your curriculum and share
the private repository with github.com/medcloud-engineer.

Good luck! Any doubts, feel free to send an email to cv@medcloud.com.br.

## For the day of the technical interview and code review

On the date set by the recruiter, have your application running on your local machine to run the tests and to show us the points developed and possible questions. We will do a code review together with you as if you were already on our team, you will be able to explain what you thought, how you architected and how the project can evolve. Good luck!
